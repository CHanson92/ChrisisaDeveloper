        I'm an inquisitive Software Engineer currently working at Jesey-AI where
        I hope to improve mental health using my passion for technology. You'll
        find me researching and keeping up the latest in technology and in my
        spare time indulging my love of gaming &amp; martial arts. I have a 2:1
        Honours Degree in Mathematics, a Web &amp; App Development Diploma from
        RED Academy and currently completing a Computing &amp; IT degree at the
        Open University. I have a thirst for knowledge, I'm passionate about
        everything I do and this shows in the quality of work I provide. I find
        and implement new ways to show results &amp; to initiate new ideas.
