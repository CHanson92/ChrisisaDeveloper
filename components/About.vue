      I am a passionate junior developer with a diploma in Web &amp; App
      Development from RED Academy, I have a degree in Mathematics from the
      University of Hertfordshire and a finance background in the medical device
      industry. I took a gamble when I switched careers, however it has paid off
      as I found a new love for coding. I have a thirst for knowledge, I am
      curious about everything and I love to make processes easier.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I started coding, I found it incredibly satisfying as I solved
      problems. I would immediately begin to think of new ways to simplify what
      I wrote. I'm interested in all technologies, whether it's front-end,
      back-end or full-stack I will always be motivated to become the best
      developer I can be!

      In my spare time I am a technology and comics geek, I have a love for
      sports in particular martial arts, motorsport &amp; gymnastics but always
      excited to try out new sports.
