      I am a passionate junior developer with a diploma in Web &amp; App
      Development from RED Academy, I have a degree in Mathematics from the
      University of Hertfordshire and a finance background in the medical device
      industry. I took a gamble when I switched careers, however it has paid off
      as I found a new love for coding. I have a thirst for knowledge, I am
      curious about everything and I love to make processes easier. <br />
      <br />
      In my spare time I am a technology and comics geek and have a love for
      sports, in particular martial arts, motorsport &amp; gymnastics.
