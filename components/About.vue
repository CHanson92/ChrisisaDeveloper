      When I started coding, I found it incredibly satisfying as I solved
      problems. I would immediately begin to think of new ways to simplify what
      I wrote. I'm interested in all technologies, whether it's front-end,
      back-end or full-stack I will always be motivated to become the best
      developer I can be.
      <br />
      <br />In the future, I want to be making high standard contributions to a
      company where I can see the difference I've made. As a personal hobby I
      would also be working on games development to create mods for games, when
      I was a child I was star-struck at the mods that modders created and it's
      something I'd love to get into, do myself and hand something back to the
      gaming community.

      <br />In my spare time I am a technology and comics geek, I have a love
      for sports in particular martial arts, motorsport &amp; gymnastics but
      always excited to try out new sports.
